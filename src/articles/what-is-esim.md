# What is an eSIM?

An eSIM (embedded SIM) is a digital SIM card built directly into your phone. Instead of inserting a tiny plastic card, you download your mobile plan digitally. That's it.

## How eSIM Works

### Physical SIM vs eSIM
- **Physical SIM**: Tiny plastic card you insert into your phone
- **eSIM**: Digital version already built into your device

### The Process
1. Buy an eSIM plan from a provider
2. Receive a QR code via email
3. Scan the code with your phone's camera
4. Your plan activates automatically

Takes about 2 minutes. No hunting for SIM card tools or fumbling with microscopic pieces of plastic.

## Why eSIM is Better for Travel

### No Physical Swapping
- Keep your home SIM active
- Add international data without removing anything
- Switch between plans instantly
- Never lose a tiny SIM card in a foreign country

### Instant Activation
- Buy a plan online
- Activate before you travel
- Connected the moment you land
- No finding local phone shops or dealing with language barriers

### Multiple Plans
Most modern phones can store 5-10 eSIM profiles:
- Home carrier
- International data plan
- Work phone number
- Backup carrier
