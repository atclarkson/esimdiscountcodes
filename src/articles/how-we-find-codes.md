# How We Find eSIM Discount Codes

At eSIMDiscountCodes.com, we use a systematic approach to find and verify the best discount codes for eSIM providers worldwide. Here's exactly how we do it.

## Our Daily Search Process

### 1. Official Sources

We start by checking official sources first:

- Provider websites and newsletters
- Official social media accounts
- Partner program announcements
- Press releases and company blogs

### 2. Influencer and Travel Content

We monitor popular travel influencers and content creators who often share exclusive codes:

- YouTube travel channels
- Travel blogs and websites
- Instagram travel accounts
- Travel forums and communities

### 3. Coupon Aggregation Sites

We scan major coupon and deal sites to find publicly available codes:

- RetailMeNot, Honey, and similar platforms
- Deal forums like Slickdeals
- Travel-specific deal sites
- Reddit communities focused on travel deals

### 4. Community Submissions

Travelers often share codes they've found:

- User-generated content on social platforms
- Travel Facebook groups
- Discord travel communities
- Direct submissions from our visitors

## Code Verification Process

### Testing Every Code

Before any code goes live on our site:

- We test each code on the actual provider website
- We verify the discount amount is accurate
- We check expiration dates and terms
- We note any restrictions or limitations

### Regular Re-verification

- Codes are retested weekly
- We remove expired or non-working codes immediately
- We update discount amounts if they change
- We track success rates for each code

### Documentation Standards

For each code we maintain:

- **Source**: Where we found the code
- **Last tested**: When we verified it works
- **Success rate**: How often it works for users
- **Restrictions**: Any limitations or requirements
- **Expiration**: If there's a known end date

## Quality Over Quantity

### Curated Selection

We focus on finding the best codes, not the most codes:

- We typically stop at 5-6 working codes per provider
- We prioritize codes with the highest discounts
- We remove duplicate codes offering the same savings
- We focus on codes that consistently work

### Best Discount Priority

Our selection process prioritizes:

- Highest percentage discounts first
- Codes with no restrictions or limitations
- Codes that work for both new and existing customers
- Codes with longer expiration periods or no expiry

## Quality Control Standards

### Code Accuracy

- Discount percentages are verified
- We don't exaggerate savings
- We clearly state any minimum purchase requirements
- We note if codes are for new customers only

### Regular Updates

- Our database is updated daily
- Expired codes are removed within 24 hours
- New codes are added as soon as we verify them
- Popular codes are prioritized for testing

### User Feedback Integration

When visitors report issues:

- We investigate within 24 hours
- Non-working codes are retested or removed
- User success rates help us prioritize codes
- Community feedback improves our accuracy

## Challenges We Face

### Code Limitations

- Some codes have hidden restrictions
- Regional availability varies
- Expiration dates aren't always clear
- Usage limits may apply

### Provider Changes

- Companies frequently update their promotions
- Codes can expire without notice
- Discount amounts may change
- New restrictions may be added

### Balancing Quality and Freshness

- We prioritize working codes over new codes
- We maintain a balance between proven codes and fresh options
- We avoid cluttering pages with redundant codes
- We focus on codes that provide real value

## Our Commitment to You

### Transparency

- We clearly explain our testing process
- We're honest about code limitations
- We acknowledge when codes don't work
- We share our verification standards

### Accuracy First

- We'd rather have fewer codes that work than many that don't
- We remove questionable codes immediately
- We prioritize user experience over quantity
- We continuously improve our verification process

### Regular Communication

- We update our testing status regularly
- We respond to user reports quickly
- We share new findings with our community
- We're always looking for better codes
