# Privacy Policy

**Last updated: July 20, 2025**

Our privacy policy is refreshingly simple: **we don't collect your personal information**.

## What We Don't Collect

### Personal Information

- We don't ask for your name
- We don't ask for your email address
- We don't ask for your phone number
- We don't ask for your location
- We don't ask for any personal details whatsoever

### Browsing Data

- We don't track your browsing habits
- We don't store your search history
- We don't monitor which pages you visit
- We don't care what codes you use

### Technical Data

- We don't collect your IP address
- We don't fingerprint your device
- We don't store session data
- We don't use tracking pixels

## What We Don't Do

### No User Analytics

- We don't use Google Analytics
- We don't use Facebook Pixel
- We don't use behavioral tracking scripts
- We don't monitor individual user behavior

### No Cookies (Almost)

- We don't use tracking cookies
- We don't use analytics cookies
- We don't use advertising cookies
- The only cookies might be basic functional ones from our hosting provider

### No Email Lists

- We don't have a newsletter
- We don't send marketing emails
- We don't collect email addresses
- We don't spam anyone

### No User Accounts

- We don't require registration
- We don't have user profiles
- We don't store preferences
- We don't track usage patterns

## What We Do Use

### Google Search Console

- We use Google Search Console to monitor our site's performance in search results
- This service may collect aggregated, anonymized data about search queries that lead to our site
- Google processes this data, not us - we only see aggregated reports
- This helps us understand which discount codes people are searching for
- No individual user data is collected or accessible to us

## Our Philosophy

### We Don't Care Who You Are

- Use our codes or don't - we don't care
- You're anonymous to us
- We have no interest in your personal data
- Your privacy is completely intact

### Simple Business Model

- We show discount codes
- Some codes earn us affiliate commissions
- You save money on eSIM plans
- Everyone wins, no tracking required

### No Data = No Problems

- We can't lose your data because we don't have it
- We can't be hacked for your information
- We can't sell your data to anyone
- We can't accidentally expose your privacy

## Third-Party Services

### Hosting Provider

- Our website is hosted by Cloudflare Pages
- They may collect basic server logs (standard practice)
- We don't control or access this data
- Refer to Cloudflare's privacy policy for their practices

### Google Search Console

- Google collects anonymized search performance data
- We only see aggregated reports (e.g., "100 people searched for holafly codes")
- No individual user data is shared with us
- This helps us improve our content for search

### eSIM Providers

- When you click our links, you go to their websites
- Their privacy policies apply once you leave our site
- We don't share any information about you with them
- Any data collection happens on their sites, not ours

### CDN Services

- We use Font Awesome and Google Fonts via CDN
- These services may log basic request data
- We don't control this data collection
- We don't receive any user data from these services

## Your Rights

Since we don't collect your data, there's nothing to:

- Request access to
- Ask us to delete
- Request corrections for
- Ask us to transfer

## Changes to This Policy

If we ever decide to start collecting data (which we won't), we'll update this policy. But honestly, we like not dealing with user data. It's simpler this way.

## Contact Information

We don't provide contact information because we don't want to deal with support requests. The codes either work or they don't. If they don't work, try a different one.

## Legal Compliance

### GDPR

- We don't collect personal data, so GDPR largely doesn't apply
- You have no data with us to request or delete
- We don't track EU users any differently than others
- Google Search Console data is processed by Google under their GDPR compliance

### CCPA

- We don't sell personal information (because we don't have any)
- We don't collect personal information for business purposes
- You have nothing to opt out of

### Other Regulations

- Most privacy laws don't apply when you don't collect data
- We're compliant by default through data minimization
- Our approach is "privacy by design" - we designed ourselves out of privacy concerns

---

**TL;DR: We show discount codes, you use them or don't, we don't know or care who you are. Google Search Console gives us anonymous search stats to help improve our content. Your privacy is still 100% intact.**
