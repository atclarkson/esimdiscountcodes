## Why Follow These Creators?

### They Actually Travel

Unlike most "travel experts" who write listicles from their couch, these people are actually out there doing it. They know which eSIM providers work where, what the real costs are, and how to avoid tourist traps.

### Real Experience

- They've tested eSIMs in dozens of countries
- They share what actually works (and what doesn't)
- They deal with real travel problems in real time
- They're not just regurgitating marketing materials

### Honest Reviews

Most of these creators are pretty honest about what sucks. If an eSIM provider has terrible coverage in Thailand, they'll tell you. If a destination is overpriced, they'll say so.

## That's It

Those are our travel tips:

1. Use our discount codes
2. Follow people who actually travel

Everything else is just common sense: don't lose your passport, don't drink the water in sketchy places, and always have backup plans.

**Need those discount codes?** Head back to our [homepage](/) and pick your eSIM provider.
