- **Hong Kong/Taiwan**: Many Samsung devices
- **Older budget phones**: Most phones under $300
- **Carrier-locked phones**: Even if hardware supports it, carrier may disable it

### Check Before You Buy

Just because a phone model supports eSIM doesn't mean YOUR specific device does. Regional variants often differ.

## Carrier Compatibility

### Your Phone Must Be Unlocked

- Carrier-locked phones can't use travel eSIMs
- Contact your carrier to unlock before traveling
- Some carriers charge unlock fees

### Dual SIM Support

Most eSIM phones support:

- One physical SIM + one eSIM (simultaneously)
- Multiple stored eSIM profiles (switch between them)
- Some newer models: dual eSIM (no physical SIM slot)

## Common Issues

### Why Your Compatible Phone Might Not Work

- **Software version**: Update to latest iOS/Android
- **Carrier restrictions**: Some corporate plans disable eSIM
- **Regional firmware**: Phone bought in restricted region
- **Hardware damage**: eSIM chip can fail like any component

### Troubleshooting Steps

1. Update to latest software
2. Check carrier unlock status
3. Restart phone
4. Contact your current carrier
5. Try a different eSIM provider

## The Bottom Line

If you have a flagship phone from the last 3-4 years, you probably have eSIM. If you have a budget phone or something from China, you probably don't.
