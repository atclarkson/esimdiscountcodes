# About eSIM Discount Codes

We find discount codes for eSIM providers. Use them or don't - we don't care.

## What We Do

We collect working discount codes for eSIM providers and put them on this website. That's it. No fancy mission statement, no corporate nonsense.

### Our Process

- Find codes from public sources
- Test them to make sure they work
- Put the working ones on the website
- Remove expired ones

### What We Don't Do

- We don't provide customer support
- We don't answer questions about eSIM technology
- We don't help you troubleshoot your travel plans
- We don't care if the codes don't work for you

## Why This Site Exists

eSIM discount codes are scattered all over the internet. We got tired of hunting for them, so we made this site to collect them in one place. If it helps other people save money, cool. If not, whatever.

## How We Make Money

Some of the codes on this site are affiliate links. When you use them, we might earn a commission. We're upfront about this because we're not trying to hide anything.

The affiliate codes usually get you the same or better discounts than public codes, so everyone wins.

## Our Standards

### Code Quality

- We only post codes that actually work
- We test them regularly
- We remove dead codes
- We focus on the best discounts, not the most codes

### No Bullshit

- We don't exaggerate savings
- We don't make up fake urgency ("Limited time only!")
- We don't spam you with popups
- We don't track you around the internet

### Simple Approach

- Codes either work or they don't
- You either save money or you don't
- The site either helps you or it doesn't
- We either make money or we don't

## What We're Not

### We're Not Customer Service

- Don't email us asking how to install an eSIM
- Don't ask us which provider is best for your trip
- Don't complain if a code doesn't work
- We're not here to hold your hand

### We're Not Travel Experts

- We don't review eSIM providers
- We don't give travel advice
- We don't compare coverage maps
- We just find discount codes

### We're Not Your Friend

- We don't want to build a community
- We don't want your feedback (unless a code is broken - report bad code feature coming soon, for now if a code doesn't work, try another one)
- We don't want to hear your travel stories
- We just want to provide working discount codes

## The Bottom Line

We built this site because we needed it ourselves. If it helps you save money on eSIMs, great. If not, there are plenty of other coupon sites on the internet.

Use the codes or don't. We may get paid if you do (or we won't, and that's fine too).
